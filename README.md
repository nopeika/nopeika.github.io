hi i write things 

i'm well aware that this is not how you use github but i think it's fine as long as i stay under 500 megabytes

thanks to orderedlist for the theme base, i just removed things

waah, take my [stuff](https://nopeika.github.io/toc.md) leave me alone

that's a table of contents btw
