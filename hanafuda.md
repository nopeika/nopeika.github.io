database of card stuff because i forget everything.



Poka:
Deal 6 cards to both players, then flip the top card from the deck. Dealer goes first. If the dealer has a card from the next month then the flipped card, he plays it (e.g. flipped card is August, dealer can play 1 card from September, if he has it). If the dealer doesn't have the next card required in the sequence, other player can now play the next required card if he has it. If December is showing, play January.

Example of play. Flipped card is March, dealer plays April, then May, then passes, non-dealer plays June, then passes, dealer plays July, then passes.

If neither player has the next card required, new card is flipped. Player who passes first out of the two goes first after the new card is flipped.

Player who gets rid of his cards in hand first wins a go stone. First to 5 go stones wins the match.

There are some special rules:

If the card showing on the table is January, and you have January and February, you can play both of these cards at once. (There are many versions of this rule)

There are 3 wild cards you can play at any time, those are Crane, January slip and the ummm... bird from February.

You can also win 2 stones in one hand if you do this: get rid of all your cards on your first turn, have 3 pairs, 3 January cards or 3 wild cards in your starting hand. If you have 4 cards of the same month, you win 5 stones (and hence the game). But if both players have 4 of a kind, it's a draw.
